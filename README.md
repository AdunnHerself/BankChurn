**Bank Churn Prediction Project**
This repository contains the code and data used to build a model to predict bank customer churn.

**Project Overview**
Customer churn is a major concern for banks, as it refers to customers closing their accounts and taking their business elsewhere.  
This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can predict churn risk based on customer data.  
By understanding which customers are at high risk of churning, 
banks can implement targeted retention strategies to improve customer satisfaction and loyalty.

**Data**

  NumOfProducts      
  HasCrCard        
  IsActiveMember   
  EstimatedSalary  


**Running the Project**
